1. Number Variable

Classic Variable assignement with "=" operator. You can also declare a variable using the "var" keyword or the "const" keyword, which declares a constant variable that cannot be reassigned a new value.
In modern JavaScript, it's recommended to use let instead of var, and to use const when declaring a constant variable.
